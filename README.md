# Blackjack-Game
A simple game of Blackjack, written in OOP Python

This was a project I made while taking a Udemy course on Python, entitled
"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022", created by Dr. Angela Yu

I created this Blackjack program as a Capstone Project in Day 11

V2.0 UPDATE:
  As I learned more about basic Object-Oriented Programming principles, I updated this
  program to be object-oriented
    - Added a game master file and a player file, with respective classes for each
